# Chatbot Implementation!

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:

Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)
The main value props of LangChain are:

Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
Off-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks
Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For complex applications, components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.
